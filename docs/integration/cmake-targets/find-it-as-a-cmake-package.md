# Find it as a CMake Package

If you have the library installed, you can call

```cmake
find_package(Scistats)
```

from your CMake build script. 

When creating your executable, link the library to the targets you want:

```
add_executable(my_target main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_target PUBLIC scistats)
```

Add this header to your source files:

```cpp
#include <scistats/scistats.h>
```
